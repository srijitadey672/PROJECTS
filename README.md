# PROJECTS
This web app features a login interface and a sign-up form for users, with prompts to create an account if none exists. It also includes an admin panel exclusively for mentors, displaying user information from a linked database.
The web application is designed to provide users with a login interface, a sign-up form, and an admin panel specifically tailored for mentors. These interfaces are accessible to the public and linked to a database to store user information securely.

The login interface allows existing users to log in with their credentials, while the sign-up form enables new users to create accounts by providing necessary information such as username, email, and password. If a user attempts to log in without an account, they are prompted to create one using the sign-up form.

In addition to the user interfaces, there is an admin panel exclusively for mentors. This panel displays a table of registered user information, providing mentors with insights into the user base. Mentors can use this information to better tailor their services or support to the users.

Overall, the web application provides a seamless experience for both users and mentors, facilitating easy registration, login, and access to relevant information through the admin panel.
